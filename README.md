# ToDo Bank

## Project Overview
ToDo Bank is a modern banking web application focused on providing secure and innovative authentication methods. Users can create accounts, manage their finances, and perform transactions securely.

## Features
- *Transaction Approval with Adaptive Security*: Transactions may require additional verification based on risk assessment (e.g., AI-driven fraud detection, geolocation-based authorization).
- *User Registration & Authentication*: Secure login and registration using Spring Security with encrypted passwords.
- *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*: Users can enable MFA via OTP (One-Time Passwords) or other secure methods.
- *User Profile Management*: Edit account details and view transaction history.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Secure Login with Multi-Factor Authentication

### Story 2: Admin User Management
As an admin, I want to manage user accounts, including activating/deactivating accounts, so that I can maintain security.
